## <i class="fa fa-folder-open-o fa-2x" aria-hidden="true" style="center"></i> Gustatory Perception
The gustatory system is a gateway to nutrient sensing, yet it is the least understood of our senses. We ask how taste is represented in the human brain and how neural taste processing links to behavior. To address these questions, we also develop long-needed stimulation and experimental protocols suited for psychophysical and psychophysiological studies and we are assessing the reliability, validity, and practicality of these measures and procedures.

## <i class="fa fa-folder-open-o fa-2x" aria-hidden="true" style="center"></i>  Multimodal interaction & integration 
Taste perception seldomly occurs in isolation but taste co-occurs rather with the visual appearance, smell, sound, touch, texture, and temperature of a food stimulus. All sensory inputs influence how we perceive, and eventually, accept or reject the food object. Food perception is therefore multisensory in nature and so is our research. We try to better describe how the different sensory systems interact to shape behavior and how they are integrated at the neural level.

## <i class="fa fa-folder-open-o fa-2x" aria-hidden="true" style="center"></i>  Contextual effects on taste
We constantly sample our environment for information or cues that arouse expectations about future events. What are the neural mechanisms by which expectations shape taste perception? What are the behavioral consequences of our neural states representing food in contexts? What is the role of prior experience and knowledge on taste and food perception?

Together with Jens Blechert (Salzburg) and Niko A. Busch (MÃ¼nster) we have developed a comprehensive database consisting of over 1,000 food and non-food images and relevant meta data for research on food perception, eating, and appetite.
